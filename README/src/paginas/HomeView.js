                <h2>Our Product</h2>
                <p>Our product is a training simulator for Regal Rednox that consists of a Unity game: an escape room simulator. These games connect to an SQL database, which is reflected in our web application. The web application is built using HTML, CSS, React, and Django for the backend, and we have our own Django REST API for communication. The simulator provides employees with a realistic and engaging environment in which to practice identifying and responding to potential hazards in the workplace, ultimately helping to make their jobs safer and more efficient.</p>
